This script implements a calculator using functions, while loops, and case statements as a practice exercise. The aim was to hone skills in utilizing these programming constructs effectively.

At the outset, the script defines several arithmetic functions to handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. Each function is tailored to perform its specific mathematical operation, ensuring modularity and readability within the codebase. Additionally, an exit function is included to gracefully terminate the program upon user request, triggered by selecting option 5.

The main function orchestrates the calculator's workflow. It establishes an infinite loop to continuously prompt the user for input, facilitating the selection of desired arithmetic operations. Leveraging a case statement, the script dynamically invokes the appropriate arithmetic function corresponding to the user's chosen operation.

In essence, this calculator script serves as a practical application of fundamental programming concepts, offering an opportunity for hands-on learning and skill refinement.
